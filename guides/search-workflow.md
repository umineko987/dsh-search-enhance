# Search workflow architecture

English | [简体中文](search-workflow.zh.md)

This document describes how Search Enhance routes a request from discovery to source retention and page verification. Installation and configuration stay in the main [README](../README.md).

The plugin keeps discovery, retention, and verification separate:

1. **Discovery:** `web_search` and `docs_search` find answers, snippets, and candidate URLs. This material is discovery metadata, not proof that a page contains a claim.
2. **Retention:** complete bounded source records can be stored under a `source_ref`, independent of how many links fit in the first tool result.
3. **Verification:** `web_extract` retrieves selected pages. The Agent can then distinguish “a Provider found this” from “the fetched page states this.”

Prefer `web_extract` for webpage bodies such as articles, blogs, repository READMEs, and model cards. Prefer the host's `web_fetch`, when available, for raw JSON APIs and structured responses such as arXiv XML/Atom. Use HTTPS directly when available. HTTP 200 with only a title or an app shell is not usable page-body evidence: explicitly choose a suitable enabled extraction Provider instead of repeatedly fetching the same shell. Do not bypass URL safety checks.

Independent `web_search` and `web_extract` calls within one model step may overlap up to DSH's concurrency limit. Source record writes still use the existing serial queue, keeping each call identity and source reference separate.

## Fixed model-facing surface

The model sees the same five search tools throughout an Agent run:

| Tool | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `web_search` | Run the main Grok-compatible search and merge user-selected supplementary sources. |
| `docs_search` | Query Context7 with an explicit library identity, or use Exa for broader discovery. |
| `web_extract` | Retrieve one selected page with a required, user-enabled `provider`. |
| `search_tools` | Return manifests for deferred capabilities without registering more model tools. |
| `search_call` | Execute a deferred operation after it becomes active. |

`web_search` is installed through the Agent integration so existing DSH Presets and tool guards remain authoritative. The plugin does not add a second general-search tool or re-enable search where the Agent has disabled it.

Native Tool Mode and Code Mode use the same schemas, operation policy, and canonical outputs. Disclosure changes operation availability, not the model-facing tool list or its ordering.

## Deferred capabilities

`search_tools` can disclose one or more of five capability groups:

| Capability | Deferred operations | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `context7` | `context7_resolve_library_id`, `context7_query_docs`, `context7_get_library_docs`, `context7_get_cached_doc_raw` | Resolve an exact library, query its docs, or inspect a cached document. |
| `sources` | `search_sources` | Page through a retained source record. |
| `site_map` | `web_map` | Discover bounded candidate URLs below a known site. |
| `planning` | `research_plan` | Build an offline plan for explicit deep or multi-source research. |
| `diagnostics` | `search_diagnostics` | Show masked configuration or explicitly test Provider connectivity. |

Activation follows these rules:

1. In the default `progressive` mode, a newly disclosed capability becomes callable on the next model step.
2. In `all` mode, deferred operations are active immediately, but they still run through `search_call`.
3. `search_call` rejects an inactive or unknown operation; it does not bypass the registry.
4. When `web_search` or `docs_search` returns a `source_ref`, the plugin activates `sources` and appends the real `search_sources` manifest automatically.
5. Disclosure never registers each operation as another model tool. The five-tool surface stays fixed.

## End-to-end flow

A typical sourced answer proceeds as follows:

1. The Agent sends a general current-information request to `web_search`, or a documentation request to `docs_search`.
2. `web_search` starts the main Grok-compatible search and every user-selected supplemental Provider in parallel. Exa, Tavily, and Firecrawl each receive the same independent source-count cap; unselected Providers are never requested. No profile or query silently enables another Provider.
3. Search sources are bounded and normalized. The web-search quality pipeline de-duplicates equivalent URLs and can prioritize official, primary, version-matching, and fresher sources.
4. `docs_search` uses a supplied `library_id` directly, resolves a supplied `library_name` through Context7, or uses Exa when no library identity is known and `provider: "auto"` is selected.
5. If a complete source record is retained, the result includes `source_ref`. The Agent can use `search_sources` through `search_call` on the next step in `progressive` mode.
6. For important claims, the Agent selects authoritative URLs and calls `web_extract` with one explicit `provider` from the enabled list in its tool description. Only that Provider runs; unavailable, unsupported, or failed extraction does not trigger another route.
7. Site mapping, granular Context7 work, research planning, and diagnostics are disclosed only when the task requires them.
8. The Agent writes the final response from the main answer, retained sources, and any page bodies it actually retrieved, preserving source links and the distinction between discovery and fetched evidence.

A `source_ref` points to a source list; it is not page content. Claim-level conclusions should rely on selected pages retrieved with `web_extract` whenever practical.
